- Prompt:
```
Build a full-featured "Smart Daily Expense Tracker" Android module using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Clean Architecture (domain/data/presentation), and Hilt for DI. Follow MVVM with StateFlow, Navigation Compose, and modern Material 3 UI/UX.

Functional scope:
- Screens:
  1) Expense Entry: title, amount (â‚¹), category (Staff, Travel, Food, Utility), optional notes (<=100 chars), optional receipt image (mock), submit with validation and add animation; show real-time "Total Spent Today" at top.
  2) Expense List: default Today view, filter by date (calendar/mock), toggle group by category/time, show totals and empty state.
  3) Expense Report: last 7 days daily totals and category-wise totals with bar/line or pie chart (mock allowed), export simulation (PDF/CSV) and optional share intent.

Non-functional:
- State: ViewModel + StateFlow.
- Data: In-memory or Room (prefer Room) with Repository.
- Navigation: Compose Navigation between screens.
- Validation: title non-empty, amount > 0, duplicate detection (basic optional).
- Bonus: theme switcher (light/dark), local persistence (Room/Datastore), animations on add, offline-first sync (mock), reusable components.

Deliverables:
- Full source code, APK link, screenshots, README, AI usage summary, and prompt logs.
Use best-practice Compose UI/UX and keep code production-grade.
```
- Key Response Summary:
  - Set up Clean Architecture with Hilt, Room, Navigation, and Compose Material 3.
  - Implemented three screens with validation, filters, grouping, charts, and export simulation.
  - Added theme toggle, animations, and reusable components.
- Outcome/Change Made:
  - Created domain models, Room entities/DAO/DB, repository, use cases, Hilt modules, ViewModels, Compose UI, navigation graph, and theming.

- Prompt:
```
Continue building the Smart Daily Expense Tracker with Kotlin + Compose + Clean Architecture + Hilt. Prioritize modern UI/UX, polish animations, and ensure a high-quality developer experience.
```
- Key Response Summary:
  - Completed navigation, added polished Compose components (animated FAB, animated cards), and refined UI states.
- Outcome/Change Made:
  - Integrated theme toggle, improved list/empty states, and ensured consistency across screens.

- Tool: ChatGPT (Cascade)
- Prompt:
```
Make `presentation/screens/reports/ReportsScreen.kt` consistent with `presentation/screens/expense_list/ExpenseListScreen.kt` for app bars and system bars:
- Align top app bar style and actions.
- Apply the same status/navigation bar behavior.
- Provide theme toggle and FAB alignment consistent with the list screen.
```
- Key Response Summary:
  - Compared structures and unified top app bar and system bar handling.
  - Added `ThemeViewModel` + `ThemeToggleButton` and consistent `AnimatedFAB` usage.
- Outcome/Change Made:
  - Updated `ReportsScreen.kt` to mirror `ExpenseListScreen.kt` patterns for app bars and actions.

- Prompt:
```
Fix `ReportsScreen.kt` bottom spacing: content should not reserve a nonexistent bottom navigation bar. Only offset for the FAB where needed.
```
- Key Response Summary:
  - Removed phantom bottom bar padding; kept FAB-safe spacing at end of content.
- Outcome/Change Made:
  - Replaced hardcoded bottom padding with a trailing `Spacer(80.dp)` similar to the list screen.

- Prompt:
```
Prepare submission artifacts at repo root: include developer name, README, App Overview, AI Usage Summary, Prompt Logs, Features Checklist, APK link, Screenshots note, latest resume, and full source code. Create/organize files and link from README.
```
- Key Response Summary:
  - Created and linked required documents and stubs from README.
- Outcome/Change Made:
  - Added `NAME.txt`, `PROMPT_LOGS.md`, `FEATURES_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/APK_LINK.md`, `docs/screenshots/README.md`, and `resume.txt`; updated `README.md`.

## Curated Effective Prompts

Use the following concise prompts to drive consistent, high-quality development and UI/UX improvements for this app.

- Date/Time: 2025-09-17 (IST)
- Tool: ChatGPT (Cascade)

1) Core App Build (Clean Architecture + Compose + Hilt)
```
Build a production-grade Smart Daily Expense Tracker in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and Material 3. Use Clean Architecture (domain/data/presentation), MVVM with StateFlow, Hilt DI, Room for persistence, and Navigation Compose. Implement screens for Add Expense, Expense List (Today by default, filter/grouping), and Reports (last 7 days with charts and export simulation). Ensure robust validation, modern UI/UX, animations, theme toggle (light/dark), and reusable components.
```

2) Make Dialogs Beautiful and Usable
```
Audit all dialogs (AlertDialog/Modal) and upgrade to modern M3 patterns: add leading icons, clear titles/labels, height constraints with scroll, row-level selection, and explicit confirm/cancel/clear actions. Keep state temporary until Apply. Ensure accessible touch targets and dark-mode contrast.
```

3) System Bars in Dark Mode
```
Fix status/navigation bars to match app theme. In dark mode the bottom navigation should be dark with light icons; the status bar should use themed surface with correct icon contrast. Use Accompanist System UI Controller. Avoid content being hidden behind system bars.
```

4) Elevate Overall UI/UX Polish
```
Add collapsing TopAppBar scroll behavior, animated list items, improved empty states with icons/guidance, subtle motion for progress/success, and a global rounded shape system. Prefer edge-to-edge with proper insets and consistent theming.
```

5) Navigate to Expense Detail on Tap
```
Enable onClick on expense cards and navigate to the expense detail screen using its ID. Keep ripple/haptic feedback and preserve existing animations.
```

6) Export Flow Feedback
```
Polish the export flow in Reports: radio-select format in a dialog with icon; Apply/Cancel actions; animated exporting status; snackbar on success; maintain strong dark-mode contrast.
```

7) Build and Release Hygiene
```
Run Gradle build (assembleDebug), verify device/emulator, install and launch the app. Provide APK link and screenshots. Ensure README includes setup, features, and architecture notes.
```

These prompts are intentionally concise and outcome-focused to be copied into future sessions for rapid, consistent progress.
